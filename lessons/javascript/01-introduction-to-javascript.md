## 📝 Basic Syntax

### Comments
Comments are notes in your code that JavaScript ignores:

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

/*
  This is a
  multi-line comment
*/
```

### Printing to Console

```javascript
console.log("I love coding!");
console.log(42);
console.log(true);
```

### Variables
Variables store data:

```javascript
let name = "Amina";
let age = 16;
let isStudent = true;

console.log(name);  // Output: Amina
console.log(age);   // Output: 16
```

### Simple Math

```javascript
console.log(5 + 3);   // 8
console.log(10 - 4);  // 6
console.log(6 * 7);   // 42
console.log(20 / 4);  // 5
```
